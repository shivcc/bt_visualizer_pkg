# Behavior Tree Visualizer for ROS 2
A simple and intuitive graphical tool to visualize BehaviorTree XML files, designed for ROS 2 (Jazzy Jellyfish). This tool helps developers and roboticists quickly understand, debug, and present robot behavior patterns by rendering them as a clear and interactive tree diagram.


![demo](https://github.com/shivcc/bt_visualizer_pkg/blob/9b03d3dbff00c8b9eef7c6653d03d6efd20a0b5f/resource/bt_demo.gif)

## Features
Load from XML: Directly load and parse BehaviorTree.CPP v4 format .xml files.

Multiple Themes: Choose between Dark, Light, and Forest themes to suit your preference.

## Interactive Canvas:

Pan: Hold and drag the Middle Mouse Button or Left Mouse Button to move around the tree.

Zoom: Hold Ctrl (or Cmd on macOS) and use the Mouse Scroll Wheel to zoom in and out. The zoom is centered on the cursor for easy navigation.

High-Quality Image Export: Save the current tree view as a high-resolution (300 DPI) .png image, perfect for documentation and presentations.

Intelligent Layout: An automatic layout algorithm prevents node overlaps, even in complex trees.

Color-Coded Nodes: Nodes are colored by their type (Control, Action, Condition, etc.) for at-a-glance identification. Their definitions are as follows

ðŸŸ¡ Control Nodes (Amber/Yellow): Nodes that direct and controls the execution of child nodes. These are akin to if-else statements, for loops, or switches in traditional programming.

Examples: Sequence, Fallback (also called a Selector), Parallel.

ðŸŸ¢ Action Nodes (Green): These are the "workhorses" of the tree. They perform an actual task or action and can take time to execute (i.e., they can return RUNNING).

Examples: MoveTo, PickUpObject, Wait, CalculatePath.

ðŸ”µ Condition Nodes (Blue): These are simple "checkers." They ask a question about the state of the robot or the world and immediately return SUCCESS or FAILURE. They never return RUNNING.

Examples: IsBatteryLow, IsObjectInGripper, HasPathBeenCalculated.

ðŸŸ£ SubTree Nodes (Purple): A SubTree node represents an entire, separate Behavior Tree that is being included and executed at that point. They are useful for creating modular and reusable behaviors and is crucial for building complex behaviors without making one giant, unreadable tree.

ðŸŸ  Decorator Nodes (Orange): These are special nodes that have only one child. Their purpose is to modify or "decorate" the result of the child they wrap.

Examples: Inverter (flips SUCCESS to FAILURE and vice-versa), RetryUntilSuccessful (retries its child a number of times), Timeout (makes its child fail if it runs for too long).

âš« Unknown Nodes (Grey): This is a fallback color. It's used for any node tag in the XML that doesn't match the patterns for the other types. This often happens with custom-named nodes.

## Installation
### 1. Dependencies
This tool is designed for ROS 2 Jazzy Jellyfish. Before building, ensure you have the following system dependencies installed:

Pillow: The Python Imaging Library, used for image export.

Ghostscript: Required by Pillow to process PostScript data for high-resolution image saving.

### Update package lists
`sudo apt-get update`

### Install Pillow and Ghostscript
`sudo apt-get install python3-pil ghostscript`

### 2. Build from Source
Clone this repository into your ROS 2 workspace, build, and source it.

### Navigate to your ROS 2 workspace source directory
`cd ~/ros2_ws/src/`

### (If you haven't already) Clone the repository from GitHub
`git clone https://github.com/shivcc/bt_visualizer_pkg.git`

### Navigate to the workspace root and build the package
`cd ~/ros2_ws/`
`colcon build --packages-select bt_visualizer_pkg`

### Source the workspace every time you open a new terminal
`source install/setup.bash`

Usage
To run the visualizer node, execute the following command in a terminal that has the workspace sourced:

`ros2 run bt_visualizer_pkg visualizer`

The application window will appear. Use the "Load XML" button to open your Behavior Tree file.

Controls Summary
Pan Canvas: Hold and Drag Left Mouse Button OR Middle Mouse Button.

Zoom Canvas: Ctrl + Mouse Scroll Wheel.

Theme Selection: Use the dropdown menu at the top.
